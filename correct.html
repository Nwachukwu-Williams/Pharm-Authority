                <p>Pharm Authority prides itself in being able to deliver most orders within 7 to 10 business days. You can be assured that we do everything humanly possible to have you the dispatching pharmacy deliver your order as quickly as possible.
                    Delays sometimes occur that are out of our control. Weather and transportation cancellations are something we cannot control. Delays due to a customer’s credit card being denied will also delay delivery as we make every attempt possible
                    to reach the customer via email or phone to ensure that we are given the proper credit information.<br>Please keep in mind that we guarantee your order will arrive within 31 business days of it being shipped. For this reason, we ask
                    that you make sure you have enough products on hand in case the delivery is delayed. If your order doesn’t arrive within the guaranteed time frame, we will request the dispatching pharmacy to re-ship your order free of charge or refund
                    your money.<br>Unfortunately, we can only supply this guarantee with certain countries as many countries have extensive customs regulations and delays. If you live in another country, please be sure to let our team know so they can
                    give you more information regarding shipping to your country. Some International orders may take 4-6 weeks. Pharm authority hereby accepts no responsibility for any loss or damage to your package; however, we will do our best to have
                    your order delivered through a second attempt if necessary.
