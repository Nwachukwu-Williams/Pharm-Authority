                        Delays sometimes occur that are out of our control. Weather and transportation cancellations are something we cannot control. Delays due to a customer’s credit card being denied will also delay delivery as we make every attempt

                        we will do our best to have your order delivered through a second attempt if necessary.

                        <p>Yes. Each of our generic products must illustrate it is comparable to its brand-name product by appearing that it conveys the same amount of active ingredient into a patient’s bloodstream circulation system within the same amount
                            of time as the brand-name product. Generic drugs that do so ought to have the same helpful impact and thus the same benefits and effects as their brand-name product, but at much less cost.</p>

                        <p>The biggest difference between most brand-name drugs and generic versions is that the brand product costs significantly more. Brand and generic drugs are therapeutically and chemically equivalent. Generic drugs are required to
                            have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as the brand-name product. Trademark laws in some countries require the drugs to look different, so the generic version may be a different
                            color, a different shape, have a different taste, or contain inactive ingredients that are different.</p>
